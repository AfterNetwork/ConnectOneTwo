--- DAY 3 -------
sounds weird.
well...
you can make a thing...
that sends an arbitrary get request to a server
what does that even mean
well...........................................
it means:
you can fetch a custom url... it doesnt care if it is an image or not... on scratch

i saw that on advanced topics already you use wikimedia.
ye
but
BUT
i use it to see which audiences are viewing my posts
ok show me the website.
there is none
its a custom thing i made, for my own siggy

can i see the image?
the image is just an svg with the date
BUT
it logs the request on the server
oh.....
ok so can you do me a favor?
one for ur own siggy?
no. A website for analytics for all users. We could possibly create a program where users opt in to see their audience for viewrs and stuff
(basicly youtube analytics for scratch.)
